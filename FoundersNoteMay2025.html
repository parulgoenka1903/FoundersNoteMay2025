                We were thrilled to be part of the NASSCOM GCC Summit in Hyderabad‚Äîan event that brought together over 1,300 global leaders and 80+ visionary speakers to shape the next chapter of global capability centers.

                <b>SelectPrism</b> is our AI-led interview platform, designed to automate L1/L2 interviews through AI-driven video interactions, contextual question generation, and intelligent candidate evaluation. We have made key enhancements to SelectPrism, including the launch of Interview v2 ‚Äì a faster, real-time version that significantly improves the candidate experience by solving for latency issues. We have also started POCs with a few clients and are now conducting interviews with actual users (external candidates). Early feedback has been largely positive and we are excited about what‚Äôs ahead.

                <b>TechM RMS go live:</b><br>
                Our journey with Tech Mahindra began in June 2023, when Prismforce entered a highly competitive evaluation process at the very last moment. Two other formidable players had already completed their proof of concepts (POCs), and expectations were well set. Despite this, we jumped in and, within just two months, delivered a comprehensive POC covering SkillPrism, IntelliPrism, and OutlookPrism (including optimization allocation algorithm) ‚Äì showcasing the full depth of our platform‚Äôs capabilities. That we were able to win against such strong contenders, despite the late start, is a true testament to the strength of our product and the sheer execution rigor of our team. Kudos to Chinmay Misra, Ankit Agarwal, and the broader solution and delivery team for pulling this off against the odds.<br><br>
                But the real journey was only beginning. It took another 12 months of intense negotiations and contracting to finalize the agreement. A big shoutout to our sales, solutioning, and legal teams who navigated this complex process with tenacity and secured a largely out-of-the-box product contract with minimal customizations ‚Äì a rare outcome in deals of this scale and complexity.<br><br>
                Then started the journey of making sure that IntelliPrism is ready for the mammoth task ahead of handling a resource pool of 80k+ resources - in terms of search & match capabilities, reporting and dashboarding and managing complex workflows for a xx member RMG team. The great job on load testing and performance testing led by xx, yy, zz etc helped us achieve minimal errors on going live.<br><br>
                But things didn‚Äôt end there, at the last minute the client threw a spanner in the works - with a last minute change (IBU & IBG from project master- but this mandatory field was missing from certain opportunities- demand form validations had to change and integrations had to change), the entire team worked day and night till the last minute to ensure that things were up and running as a result. Thank you xx, yy, zz without that last minute push we wouldn‚Äôt have been able to achieve this go live date.
